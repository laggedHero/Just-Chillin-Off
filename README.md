# Just Chillin' Off

An Android app bootstrap with tests support.

It's here so I don't have to set it up again and again. It uses [Spoon][1] as the runner (and there's some test examples).

Cheers!

### And this project name means...?

Nothing special about it. I set this up while I had some free time at my job...
